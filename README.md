Rewrite in Markdown
===================

# Introduction

Hi! My name is Moriah Johnson, and this is my senior year of TWC.

## Background

**I come to 4662W with some experience, but I will definitely still benefit from this class!!**

### HTML

I am comfortable with HTML and CSS, as they were used in my previous job's content management system. Additionally, I took Web Design last semester, which taught the concepts more in-depth. In web design, I used HTML to create graphics and moving images rather than text exclusively. Before these projects, I had relied exclusively on an online text editor to validate my entries for me, but the projects taught me to write code from scratch.

### DITA   

I spent my summer internship learning about and practicing DITA XML using Oxygen Author. We converted DITA topics from Arbortext into Oxygen, then migrated the files into Teamcenter content management system for desktop publishing. For me, the best way to learn DITA was to jump into a project headfirst and work things out through trial, error, and plenty of Google searches. It was helpful to have a background in HTML since the two languages share qualities.

## Learning interests

This semester, I look forward to learning more about Markdown and better navigating GitHub. I have seen many job requirements involving familiarity with Github, so this addition of knowledge is valuable!

## Skills for success

Regardless of digital technology used, a strong understanding of topic-based authoring is important for any technical writer. In traditional education, students are taught to perfect the essay, but modern information culture requires a different approach to writing. Effective technical writing emphasizes clarity and conciseness, which is valued by both _**computers and humans**_.

The wider industry also values the following qualities:  
* adaptability
* research skills
* troubleshooting skills
* a self-motivated learning style

*Tech writers need to be big-picture thinkers, balancing the needs of platforms and end users.*
